# 📌 Business Rules

The system strictly enforces the following rules:

- Vehicle registration number must be unique.
- Retired vehicles cannot be assigned to trips.
- Vehicles under maintenance cannot be dispatched.
- Drivers with expired licenses cannot be assigned.
- Suspended drivers cannot be assigned.
- A vehicle already on a trip cannot be assigned again.
- A driver already on a trip cannot be assigned again.
- Cargo weight cannot exceed vehicle capacity.
- Dispatching a trip automatically changes driver and vehicle status to **On Trip**.
- Completing a trip automatically restores driver and vehicle status to **Available**.
- Cancelling a trip restores assigned resources.
- Creating a maintenance record automatically changes vehicle status to **In Shop**.
- Closing maintenance restores vehicle availability.
